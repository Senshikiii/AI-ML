# AI/ML

This is my **6-week intensive AI/ML bootcamp**, spending 8+ hours a day building skills to become startup-ready as an AI engineer.  
Everything here is documented â€” from math to projects to deployment.



## ðŸ“… Timeline & Progress
- [ ] **Week 1 â€” Math + Neural Networks**
- [ ] **Week 2 â€” Deep Learning**
- [ ] **Week 3 â€” Transformers**
- [ ] **Week 4 â€” Transformers (Advanced)**
- [ ] **Week 5 â€” MLOps Pipeline**
- [ ] **Week 6 â€” Deployment**

## ðŸš€ Goal
By the end of Week 6, I will:
- Build and deploy neural networks from scratch
- Train and fine-tune transformer models
- Deploy production-ready AI apps with MLOps
- Be startup-ready as an AI engineer
